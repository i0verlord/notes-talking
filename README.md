# notes-talking web-app

# day 1: starting working on a notes taking app.

# day 2: complete the normal functionality of the card.

# day 3: setting up the back end of the project.

# day 4: adding functionality to add notes.
# (problem): the header and the delete button are both mergered together and are triggering both mouse up and delete actions together.
